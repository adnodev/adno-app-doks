## Why Adno? 

Adno is a web application for visualizing, editing and sharing readings and pathways on images. It will be of particular interest to cultural and scientific mediators, as well as researchers, archivists, librarians, etc.

Read the [About Adno page](/about) to learn more.

## How do I use Adno?

The easiest way is to join the [online service](https://w.adno.app). This documentation provides all [the information you need to get started](/en/docs/prologue/quick-start/) as well as a [number of examples](/en/example).

As Adno is free software, you can also install it yourself on your computer or server. Instructions on [Github](https://github.com/adnodev/adno).

## Can I use my own images?

Of course, they just need to be publicly available online.

## Do I need to be online to use Adno?

Yes, because the resources, especially IIIF, are only available online.

## What is IIIF?

The IIIF initiative (International Image Interoperability Framework) has become the common and standardized technical framework for the dissemination of high quality images and their metadata. For more information, please visit the [official IIIF website](https://iiif.io/).

## What are the shortcuts to search in the documentation?
